üü° Output format:
Return ONLY a valid JSON object in the following exact format (no markdown, no extra commentary):

{
  "technology_name": "${courseTitle}",
  "roadmap": [
    {
      "day": "1",
      "title": "Topic Title Here",
      "description": "Brief but specific explanation of what the user will learn.",
      "video": "https://...",
      "article": "https://..."
    },
    {
      "day": "2",
      "title": "Next Topic Title",
      "description": "Description of what will be covered on day 2.",
      "video": "https://...",
      "article": "https://..."
    }
    // Continue until all days are filled based on totalHrs and dailyHrs
  ]
}

üü† Requirements:
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Use snake_case for all JSON keys.
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†The "roadmap" array should contain one entry per day. Calculate number of days as: total_days = Math.ceil(totalHrs / dailyHrs).
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Each day's content should cover a unique topic relevant to ${courseTitle}, progressing from basic to advanced (according to the selected difficulty).
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Each day must include a valid and relevant *video* and *article* link (prefer YouTube, MDN, freeCodeCamp, W3Schools, official docs, etc).
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Ensure the content matches the selected difficulty level (${difficulty}).
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Do not repeat topics.
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Keep descriptions short, clear, and instructional.
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Output STRICTLY valid JSON. No extra formatting, no markdown, no commentary.
